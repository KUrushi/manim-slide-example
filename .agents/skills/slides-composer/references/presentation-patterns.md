# Presentation Patterns

Common structures for effective presentations using manim-slides.

---

## Pattern 1: Pyramid (Conclusion First)

The default pattern for most business and technical presentations.

**Structure:**
1. State the conclusion upfront
2. Present 2-3 supporting reasons
3. Back each reason with evidence/details
4. Restate the conclusion

**Best for:** Decision-making meetings, project proposals, status updates

**Opening:**
- "The answer is X. Here's why."
- "We should do Y. Let me show you the three reasons."

**Slide flow:**
```
[Title] -> [Conclusion] -> [Reason 1] -> [Evidence] ->
[Reason 2] -> [Evidence] -> [Reason 3] -> [Evidence] -> [Restate Conclusion]
```

## Pattern 2: Problem -> Solution -> Benefit

Natural flow for proposals and pitches.

**Structure:**
1. Present the problem (make the audience feel the pain)
2. Introduce the solution
3. Show the benefits/results
4. Call to action

**Best for:** Product pitches, improvement proposals, change management

**Opening:**
- "We're losing X hours per week because of Y."
- "There's a gap between where we are and where we need to be."

**Slide flow:**
```
[Title] -> [Current State / Problem] -> [Impact / Cost] ->
[Proposed Solution] -> [How It Works] -> [Benefits / Results] -> [Next Steps]
```

## Pattern 3: Before -> After -> Bridge

Simple and persuasive transformation story.

**Structure:**
1. Show the current state (Before)
2. Paint the desired state (After)
3. Explain how to get there (Bridge)

**Best for:** Strategy presentations, roadmaps, vision talks

**Opening:**
- "Today, we do X. Imagine if instead we could Y."
- "Here's where we are. Here's where we could be."

**Slide flow:**
```
[Title] -> [Before: Current State] -> [Pain Points] ->
[After: Vision] -> [Bridge: How We Get There] -> [Timeline / Steps] -> [Close]
```

## Pattern 4: Teaching / Explanation

For educational presentations and lectures.

**Structure:**
1. Hook: Why should the audience care?
2. Foundation: Establish shared vocabulary
3. Core concept: Build understanding progressively
4. Application: Show how to use the knowledge
5. Summary: Reinforce the key takeaways

**Best for:** Lectures, workshops, tech talks, onboarding

**Opening:**
- "Have you ever wondered why X works this way?"
- "By the end of this talk, you'll be able to Y."

**Slide flow:**
```
[Title] -> [Hook / Motivation] -> [Foundation / Setup] ->
[Concept 1] -> [Example] -> [Concept 2] -> [Example] ->
[Application] -> [Summary / Key Takeaways]
```

## Pattern 5: Data-Driven Narrative

Let data tell the story.

**Structure:**
1. State the question being investigated
2. Present data points one by one
3. Draw the pattern/insight from the data
4. State the implication and recommendation

**Best for:** Research presentations, analytics reviews, quarterly reports

**Opening:**
- "We asked the question: does X affect Y?"
- "The data tells an interesting story."

**Slide flow:**
```
[Title] -> [Question] -> [Methodology (brief)] ->
[Data Point 1] -> [Data Point 2] -> [Data Point 3] ->
[Pattern / Insight] -> [Recommendation] -> [Close]
```

---

## Pattern 6: Compare and Contrast

Side-by-side evaluation of options.

**Structure:**
1. Define the evaluation criteria
2. Present Option A
3. Present Option B
4. Compare on each criterion
5. State the recommendation

**Best for:** Technology evaluations, design reviews, vendor selection

**Opening:**
- "We have two approaches. Let me walk you through both."
- "Which option best serves our goals?"

**Slide flow:**
```
[Title] -> [Context / Criteria] ->
[Option A Overview] -> [Option A Details] ->
[Option B Overview] -> [Option B Details] ->
[Comparison] -> [Recommendation]
```

## Combining Patterns

Most effective presentations combine elements:
- Pyramid conclusion + Problem-Solution details
- Teaching structure + Data-Driven evidence
- Before-After framing + Compare-Contrast options

## Adapting to Time Constraints

| Duration | Pattern Adaptation |
|----------|-------------------|
| 5 min (lightning talk) | Pyramid only: conclusion + 2 reasons, no detail layer |
| 20 min (standard talk) | Full pattern with moderate detail |
| 45 min (lecture) | Teaching pattern with multiple concept layers |
| 60+ min (workshop) | Teaching + exercises + discussion breaks |

## Audience Adaptation

| Audience | Preferred Pattern | Key Adjustment |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Executives | Pyramid | Conclusion in first 30 seconds |
| Engineers | Teaching or Data-Driven | Show the "how", include technical detail |
| Mixed / General | Problem-Solution | Start with relatable pain point |
| Academics | Data-Driven | Methodology transparency, cite sources |
